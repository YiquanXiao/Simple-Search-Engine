Bush on January 20, 2001, in Washington D.C., the day of his first inauguration as President of the United States
Bush had originally outlined an ambitious domestic agenda, but his priorities were significantly altered following the September 11 attacks.[90] Wars were waged in Afghanistan and Iraq, and there were significant domestic debates regarding immigration, healthcare, Social Security, economic policy, and treatment of terrorist detainees. Over an eight-year period, Bush's once-high approval ratings[91] steadily declined, while his disapproval numbers increased significantly.[92] In 2007, the United States entered the longest post-World War II recession.[93]

Bush took office during a period of economic recession in the wake of the bursting of the dot-com bubble.[94] The September 11 terrorist attacks also impacted the economy.

His administration increased federal government spending from $1.789 trillion to $2.983 trillion (60 percent), while revenues increased from $2.025 trillion to $2.524 trillion (from 2000 to 2008). Individual income tax revenues increased by 14 percent, corporate tax revenues by 50 percent, and customs and duties by 40 percent. Discretionary defense spending was increased by 107 percent, discretionary domestic spending by 62 percent, Medicare spending by 131 percent, social security by 51 percent, and income security spending by 130 percent. Cyclically adjusted, revenues rose by 35 percent and spending by 65 percent.[95] The increase in spending was more than under any predecessor since Lyndon B. Johnson.[96] The number of economic regulation governmental workers increased by 91,196.[97]

The surplus in fiscal year 2000 was $237 billion – the third consecutive surplus and the largest surplus ever.[98] In 2001, Bush's budget estimated that there would be a $5.6 trillion surplus over the next ten years.[99] Facing congressional opposition, Bush held town hall-style meetings across the U.S. to increase public support for his plan for a $1.35 trillion tax cut program, one of the largest tax cuts in U.S. history.[54] Bush argued that unspent government funds should be returned to taxpayers, saying "the surplus is not the government's money. The surplus is the people's money."[54] Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan warned of a recession and Bush stated that a tax cut would stimulate the economy and create jobs.[100] Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill, opposed some of the tax cuts on the basis that they would contribute to budget deficits and undermine Social Security.[101] O'Neill disputes the claim, made in Bush's book Decision Points, that he never openly disagreed with him on planned tax cuts.[102] By 2003, the economy showed signs of improvement, though job growth remained stagnant.[54] Another tax cut was passed that year.[citation needed]

Between 2001 and 2008, GDP grew at an average annual rate of 2.125 percent,[103] less than for past business cycles.[104] Bush entered office with the Dow Jones Industrial Average at 10,587, and the average peaked in October 2007 at over 14,000. When Bush left office, the average was at 7,949, one of the lowest levels of his presidency.[105] Only four other U.S. presidents have left office with the stock market lower than when they began.[106]


Deficit and debt increases from 2001 to 2009. Gross debt has increased over $500 billion each year since the 2003 fiscal year.
Unemployment originally rose from 4.2 percent in January 2001 to 6.3 percent in June 2003, but subsequently dropped to 4.5 percent in July 2007.[107] Adjusted for inflation, median household income dropped by $1,175 between 2000 and 2007,[108] while Professor Ken Homa of Georgetown University has noted that "Median real after-tax household income went up two percent".[109] The poverty rate increased from 11.3 percent in 2000 to 12.3 percent in 2006 after peaking at 12.7 percent in 2004.[110] By October 2008, due to increases in spending,[111]: 273  the national debt had risen to $11.3 trillion,[112] more than doubling it since 2000.[113][114][unreliable source?] Most debt was accumulated as a result of what became known as the "Bush tax cuts" and increased national security spending.[115] In March 2006, then-Senator Barack Obama said when he voted against raising the debt ceiling: "The fact that we are here today to debate raising America's debt limit is a sign of leadership failure."[116] By the end of Bush's presidency, unemployment climbed to 7.2 percent.[117]

2008 financial crisis
In December 2007, the United States entered the longest post–World War II recession,[93] caused by a housing market correction, a subprime mortgage crisis, soaring oil prices, and other factors. In February 2008, 63,000 jobs were lost, a five-year record,[118] and in November, over 500,000 jobs were lost, which marked the largest loss of jobs in the United States in 34 years.[119] The Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that in the last four months of 2008, 1.9 million jobs were lost.[120] By the end of 2008, the U.S. had lost 2.6 million jobs.[121]

To aid with the situation, Bush signed a $170 billion economic stimulus package which was intended to improve the economic situation by sending tax rebate checks to many Americans and providing tax breaks for struggling businesses. The Bush administration pushed for significantly increased regulation of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in 2003,[122] and after two years, the regulations passed the House but died in the Senate. Many Republican senators, as well as influential members of the Bush Administration, feared that the agency created by these regulations would merely be mimicking the private sector's risky practices.[123][124][125] In September 2008, the crisis became much more serious beginning with the government takeover of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac followed by the collapse of Lehman Brothers and a federal bailout of American International Group for $85 billion.[126]

Many economists and world governments determined that the situation had become the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression.[127][128] Additional regulation over the housing market would have been beneficial, according to former Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan.[129] Bush, meanwhile, proposed a financial rescue plan to buy back a large portion of the U.S. mortgage market.[130] Vince Reinhardt, a former Federal Reserve economist now at the American Enterprise Institute, said "it would have helped for the Bush administration to empower the folks at Treasury and the Federal Reserve and the comptroller of the currency and the FDIC to look at these issues more closely", and additionally, that it would have helped "for Congress to have held hearings".[124]

Education and public health
Bush undertook many educational agendas, such as increasing the funding for the National Science Foundation and National Institutes of Health in his first years of office and creating education programs to strengthen the grounding in science and mathematics for American high school students. Funding for the NIH was cut in 2006, the first such cut in 36 years, due to rising inflation.[131]


President Bush signing the No Child Left Behind Act into law, January 8, 2002
One of the administration's early major initiatives was the No Child Left Behind Act, which aimed to measure and close the gap between rich and poor student performance, provide options to parents with students in low-performing schools, and target more federal funding to low-income schools. This landmark education initiative passed with broad bipartisan support, including that of Senator Ted Kennedy of Massachusetts.[132] It was signed into law by Bush in early 2002.[133] Many contend that the initiative has been successful, as cited by the fact that students in the U.S. have performed significantly better on state reading and math tests since Bush signed "No Child Left Behind" into law.[134] Critics[who?] argue that it is underfunded[135][better source needed] and that NCLBA's focus on "high-stakes testing" and quantitative outcomes is counterproductive.[136]

On November 1, 2005, Bush announced a National Strategy for Pandemic Influenza to prepare the United States for a flu pandemic, which culminated in an implementation plan published by the Homeland Security Council in May 2006.[137][138]

After being re-elected, Bush signed into law a Medicare drug benefit program that, according to Jan Crawford, resulted in "the greatest expansion in America's welfare state in forty years" – the bill's costs approached $7 trillion.[111]: 274  In 2007, Bush opposed and vetoed State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP) legislation, which was added by the Democrats onto a war funding bill and passed by Congress. The SCHIP legislation would have significantly expanded federally funded healthcare benefits and plans to children of some low-income families. It was to be funded by an increase in the cigarette tax.[139] Bush viewed the legislation as a move toward socialized health care, and asserted that the program could benefit families making as much as $83,000 per year who did not need the help.[140]

On May 21, 2008, Bush signed into law the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act, aimed to protect Americans against health insurance and employment discrimination based on a person's genetic information. The issue had been debated for 13 years before it finally became law. The measure is designed to protect citizens without hindering genetic research.[141][142]

Social services and Social Security
Following Republican efforts to pass the Medicare Act of 2003, Bush signed the bill, which included major changes to the Medicare program by providing beneficiaries with some assistance in paying for prescription drugs, while relying on private insurance for the delivery of benefits.[143] The retired persons lobby group AARP worked with the Bush Administration on the program and gave their endorsement. Bush said the law, estimated to cost $400 billion over the first ten years, would give the elderly "better choices and more control over their health care".[144]

Bush began his second term by outlining a major initiative to "reform" Social Security,[145] which was facing record deficit projections beginning in 2005. Bush made it the centerpiece of his domestic agenda despite opposition from some in the U.S. Congress.[145] In his 2005 State of the Union Address, Bush discussed the potential impending bankruptcy of the program and outlined his new program, which included partial privatization of the system, personal Social Security accounts, and options to permit Americans to divert a portion of their Social Security tax (FICA) into secured investments.[145] Democrats opposed the proposal to partially privatize the system.[145]

Bush embarked on a 60-day national tour, campaigning for his initiative in media events known as "Conversations on Social Security" in an attempt to gain public support.[146] Nevertheless, public support for the proposal declined,[147] and the House Republican leadership decided not to put Social Security reform on the priority list for the remainder of their 2005 legislative agenda.[148] The proposal's legislative prospects were further diminished by autumn 2005 due to political fallout from the response to Hurricane Katrina.[149]

Environmental policies
Main article: Domestic policy of the George W. Bush administration § Environment
Upon taking office in 2001, Bush stated his opposition to the Kyoto Protocol, an amendment to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change which seeks to impose mandatory targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions, citing that the treaty exempted 80 percent of the world's population[150] and would have cost tens of billions of dollars per year.[151] He also cited that the Senate had voted 95–0 in 1997 on a resolution expressing its disapproval of the protocol.

In May 2001, Bush signed an executive order to create an interagency task force to streamline energy projects,[152] and later signed two other executive orders to tackle environmental issues.[153]

In 2002, Bush proposed the Clear Skies Act of 2003,[154] which aimed at amending the Clean Air Act to reduce air pollution through the use of emissions trading programs. Many experts argued that this legislation would have weakened the original legislation by allowing higher emission rates of pollutants than were previously legal.[155] The initiative was introduced to Congress, but failed to make it out of committee.[citation needed]

Later in 2006, Bush declared the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands a national monument, creating the largest marine reserve to date. The Papahānaumokuākea Marine National Monument comprises 84 million acres (340,000 km2) and is home to 7,000 species of fish, birds, and other marine animals, many of which are specific to only those islands.[156] The move was hailed by conservationists for "its foresight and leadership in protecting this incredible area".[157]

Bush has said he believes that global warming is real[158] and has noted that it is a serious problem, but he asserted there is a "debate over whether it's man-made or naturally caused".[159] The Bush Administration's stance on global warming remained controversial in the scientific and environmental communities. Critics have alleged that the administration[160] misinformed the public and did not do enough to reduce carbon emissions and deter global warming.[161]
