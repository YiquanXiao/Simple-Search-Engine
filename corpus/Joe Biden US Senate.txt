In January 1973, secretary of the Senate Francis R. Valeo swore Biden in at the Delaware Division of the Wilmington Medical Center.[82][52] Present were his sons Beau (whose leg was still in traction from the automobile accident) and Hunter and other family members.[82][52] At 30, he was the sixth-youngest senator in U.S. history.[83] To see his sons, Biden traveled by train between his Delaware home and D.C.[84]—74 minutes each way—and maintained this habit throughout his 36 years in the Senate.[21]

Elected to the Senate in 1972, Biden was reelected in 1978, 1984, 1990, 1996, 2002, and 2008, regularly receiving about 60% of the vote.[85] He was junior senator to William Roth, who was first elected in 1970, until Roth was defeated in 2000.[86] As of 2022, he was the 19th-longest-serving senator in U.S. history.[87]

During his early years in the Senate, Biden focused on consumer protection and environmental issues and called for greater government accountability.[88] In a 1974 interview, he described himself as liberal on civil rights and liberties, senior citizens' concerns and healthcare but conservative on other issues, including abortion and military conscription.[89] Biden was the first U.S. senator to endorse Jimmy Carter for president in the 1976 Democratic primary.[90] Carter went on to win the Democratic nomination and defeat incumbent Republican President Gerald Ford in the 1976 election. Biden also worked on arms control.[91][92] After Congress failed to ratify the SALT II Treaty signed in 1979 by Soviet General Secretary Leonid Brezhnev and President Jimmy Carter, Biden met with Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko to communicate American concerns and secured changes that addressed the Senate Foreign Relations Committee's objections.[93] He received considerable attention when he excoriated Secretary of State George Shultz at a Senate hearing for the Reagan administration's support of South Africa despite its continued policy of apartheid.[36]

In the mid-1970s, Biden was one of the Senate's strongest opponents of race-integration busing. His Delaware constituents strongly opposed it, and such opposition nationwide later led his party to mostly abandon school integration policies.[94] In his first Senate campaign, Biden had expressed support for busing to remedy de jure segregation, as in the South, but opposed its use to remedy de facto segregation arising from racial patterns of neighborhood residency, as in Delaware; he opposed a proposed constitutional amendment banning busing entirely.[95] In 1976, Biden supported a measure forbidding the use of federal funds for transporting students beyond the school closest to them.[96] In 1977, he co-sponsored an amendment closing loopholes in that measure, which President Carter signed into law in 1978.[97]

Biden became ranking minority member of the Senate Judiciary Committee in 1981. In 1984, he was a Democratic floor manager for the successful passage of the Comprehensive Crime Control Act. His supporters praised him for modifying some of the law's worst provisions, and it was his most important legislative accomplishment to that time.[98] In 1994, Biden helped pass the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act, which included a ban on assault weapons,[99][100] and the Violence Against Women Act,[101] which he has called his most significant legislation.[102] The 1994 crime law was unpopular among progressives and criticized for resulting in mass incarceration;[103][104] in 2019, Biden called his role in passing the bill a "big mistake", citing its policy on crack cocaine and saying that the bill "trapped an entire generation".[105]

In 1993, Biden voted for a provision that deemed homosexuality incompatible with military life, thereby banning gays from serving in the armed forces.[106][107] In 1996, he voted for the Defense of Marriage Act, which prohibited the federal government from recognizing same-sex marriages, thereby barring individuals in such marriages from equal protection under federal law and allowing states to do the same.[108] In 2015, the act was ruled unconstitutional in Obergefell v. Hodges.[109]

Biden was critical of Independent Counsel Ken Starr during the 1990s Whitewater controversy and Lewinsky scandal investigations, saying "it's going to be a cold day in hell" before another independent counsel would be granted similar powers.[110] He voted to acquit during the impeachment of President Clinton.[111] During the 2000s, Biden sponsored bankruptcy legislation sought by credit card issuers.[21] Clinton vetoed the bill in 2000, but it passed in 2005 as the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act,[21] with Biden being one of only 18 Democrats to vote for it, while leading Democrats and consumer rights organizations opposed it.[112] As a senator, Biden strongly supported increased Amtrak funding and rail security.[85][113]

Brain surgeries
In February 1988, after several episodes of increasingly severe neck pain, Biden was taken by ambulance to Walter Reed Army Medical Center for surgery to correct a leaking intracranial berry aneurysm.[114][115] While recuperating, he suffered a pulmonary embolism, a serious complication.[115] After a second aneurysm was surgically repaired in May,[115][116] Biden's recuperation kept him away from the Senate for seven months.[117]

Senate Judiciary Committee

Biden was a longtime member of the Senate Committee on the Judiciary. He chaired it from 1987 to 1995 and was a ranking minority member from 1981 to 1987 and again from 1995 to 1997.[118]

As chair, Biden presided over two highly contentious U.S. Supreme Court confirmation hearings.[21] When Robert Bork was nominated in 1988, Biden reversed his approval‍—‌ given in an interview the previous year‍—‌ of a hypothetical Bork nomination. Conservatives were angered,[119] but at the hearings' close Biden was praised for his fairness, humor, and courage.[119][120] Rejecting the arguments of some Bork opponents,[21] Biden framed his objections to Bork in terms of the conflict between Bork's strong originalism and the view that the U.S. Constitution provides rights to liberty and privacy beyond those explicitly enumerated in its text.[120] Bork's nomination was rejected in the committee by a 5–9 vote[120] and then in the full Senate, 42–58.[121]

During Clarence Thomas's nomination hearings in 1991, Biden's questions on constitutional issues were often convoluted to the point that Thomas sometimes lost track of them,[122] and Thomas later wrote that Biden's questions were akin to "beanballs".[123] After the committee hearing closed, the public learned that Anita Hill, a University of Oklahoma law school professor, had accused Thomas of making unwelcome sexual comments when they had worked together.[124][125] Biden had known of some of these charges, but initially shared them only with the committee because Hill was then unwilling to testify.[21] The committee hearing was reopened and Hill testified, but Biden did not permit testimony from other witnesses, such as a woman who had made similar charges and experts on harassment.[126] The full Senate confirmed Thomas by a 52–48 vote, with Biden opposed.[21] Liberal legal advocates and women's groups felt strongly that Biden had mishandled the hearings and not done enough to support Hill.[126] In 2019, he told Hill he regretted his treatment of her, but Hill said afterward she remained unsatisfied.[127]

Senate Foreign Relations Committee

Biden was a longtime member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. He became its ranking minority member in 1997 and chaired it from June 2001 to 2003 and 2007 to 2009.[128] His positions were generally liberal internationalist.[91][129] He collaborated effectively with Republicans and sometimes went against elements of his own party.[128][129] During this time he met with at least 150 leaders from 60 countries and international organizations, becoming a well-known Democratic voice on foreign policy.[130]

Biden voted against authorization for the Gulf War in 1991,[129] siding with 45 of the 55 Democratic senators; he said the U.S. was bearing almost all the burden in the anti-Iraq coalition.[131]

Biden became interested in the Yugoslav Wars after hearing about Serbian abuses during the Croatian War of Independence in 1991.[91] Once the Bosnian War broke out, Biden was among the first to call for the "lift and strike" policy.[91][128] The George H. W. Bush administration and Clinton administration were both reluctant to implement the policy, fearing Balkan entanglement.[91][129] In April 1993, Biden held a tense three-hour meeting with Serbian leader Slobodan Milošević.[132] Biden said he had told Milošević, "I think you're a damn war criminal and you should be tried as one."[132] Biden wrote an amendment in 1992 to compel the Bush administration to arm the Bosnian Muslims, but deferred in 1994 to a somewhat softer stance the Clinton administration preferred, before signing on the following year to a stronger measure sponsored by Bob Dole and Joe Lieberman.[132] The engagement led to a successful NATO peacekeeping effort.[91] Biden has called his role in affecting Balkans policy in the mid-1990s his "proudest moment in public life" related to foreign policy.[129] In 1999, during the Kosovo War, Biden supported the 1999 NATO bombing of FR Yugoslavia.[91] He and Senator John McCain co-sponsored the McCain-Biden Kosovo Resolution, which called on Clinton to use all necessary force, including ground troops, to confront Milošević over Yugoslav actions toward ethnic Albanians in Kosovo.[129][133]

Wars in Afghanistan and Iraq

Biden was a strong supporter of the War in Afghanistan, saying, "Whatever it takes, we should do it."[134] As head of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, he said in 2002 that Iraqi president Saddam Hussein was a threat to national security and there was no other option than to "eliminate" that threat.[135] In October 2002, he voted in favor of the Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Iraq, approving the U.S. Invasion of Iraq.[129] As chair of the committee, he assembled a series of witnesses to testify in favor of the authorization. They gave testimony grossly misrepresenting the intent, history, and status of Saddam and his secular government, which was an avowed enemy of al-Qaeda, and touted Iraq's fictional possession of Weapons of Mass Destruction.[136] Biden eventually became a critic of the war and viewed his vote and role as a "mistake", but did not push for withdrawal.[129][132] He supported the appropriations for the occupation, but argued that the war should be internationalized, that more soldiers were needed, and that the Bush administration should "level with the American people" about its cost and length.[128][133]

By late 2006, Biden's stance had shifted considerably. He opposed the troop surge of 2007,[129][132] saying General David Petraeus was "dead, flat wrong" in believing the surge could work.[137] Biden instead advocated dividing Iraq into a loose federation of three ethnic states.[138] In November 2006, Biden and Leslie H. Gelb, president emeritus of the Council on Foreign Relations, released a comprehensive strategy to end sectarian violence in Iraq.[139] Rather than continue the existing approach or withdrawing, the plan called for "a third way": federalizing Iraq and giving Kurds, Shiites, and Sunnis "breathing room" in their own regions.[140] In September 2007, a non-binding resolution endorsing the plan passed the Senate,[139] but the idea failed to gain traction.[137]
