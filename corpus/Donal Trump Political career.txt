Trump's political party affiliation has changed numerous times. He registered as a Republican in 1987;[138] a member of the Independence Party, the New York state affiliate of the Reform Party, in 1999;[139] a Democrat in 2001; a Republican in 2009; unaffiliated in 2011; and a Republican in 2012.[138]

In 1987, Trump placed full-page advertisements in three major newspapers,[140] expressing his views on foreign policy and on how to eliminate the federal budget deficit.[141] He ruled out running for local office but not for the presidency.[140] In 1988, he approached Lee Atwater, asking to be put into consideration to be Republican nominee George H. W. Bush's running mate. Bush found the request "strange and unbelievable".[142]

Presidential campaigns (2000–2016)
In 2000, Trump ran in the California and Michigan primaries for nomination as the Reform Party candidate for the 2000 United States presidential election but withdrew from the race in February 2000.[143][144][145] A July 1999 poll matching him against likely Republican nominee George W. Bush and likely Democratic nominee Al Gore showed Trump with seven percent support.[146]

In 2011, Trump speculated about running against President Barack Obama in the 2012 election, making his first speaking appearance at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) in February 2011 and giving speeches in early primary states.[147][148] In May 2011, he announced he would not run,[147] and he endorsed Mitt Romney in February 2012.[149] Trump's presidential ambitions were generally not taken seriously at the time.[150]

Trump's fame and provocative statements earned him an unprecedented amount of free media coverage, elevating his standing in the Republican primaries.[151] He adopted the phrase "truthful hyperbole", coined by his ghostwriter Tony Schwartz, to describe his public speaking style.[125][152] His campaign statements were often opaque and suggestive,[153] and a record number of them were false.[154][155][156] The Los Angeles Times wrote, "Never in modern presidential politics has a major candidate made false statements as routinely as Trump has."[157][158] Trump said he disdained political correctness and frequently made claims of media bias.[159][160]

Trump campaigning in Arizona, March 2016
Trump announced his candidacy in June 2015.[161][162] His campaign was initially not taken seriously by political analysts, but he quickly rose to the top of opinion polls.[163] He became the front-runner in March 2016[164] and was declared the presumptive Republican nominee in May.[165]

Hillary Clinton led Trump in national polling averages throughout the campaign, but, in early July, her lead narrowed.[166][167] In mid-July Trump selected Indiana governor Mike Pence as his vice presidential running mate,[168] and the two were officially nominated at the 2016 Republican National Convention.[169] Trump and Clinton faced off in three presidential debates in September and October 2016. Trump twice refused to say whether he would accept the result of the election.[170]

Campaign rhetoric and political positions

Trump's political positions and rhetoric were right-wing populist.[171][172][173] Politico described them as "eclectic, improvisational and often contradictory", quoting a health-care policy expert at the American Enterprise Institute as saying that his political positions were "a total random assortment of whatever plays publicly".[174] NBC News counted "141 distinct shifts on 23 major issues" during his campaign.[175]

Trump's campaign platform emphasized renegotiating U.S.–China relations and free trade agreements such as NAFTA and the Trans-Pacific Partnership, strongly enforcing immigration laws, and building a new wall along the U.S.–Mexico border. Other campaign positions included pursuing energy independence while opposing climate change regulations such as the Clean Power Plan and the Paris Agreement, modernizing and expediting services for veterans, repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act, abolishing Common Core education standards, investing in infrastructure, simplifying the tax code while reducing taxes for all economic classes, and imposing tariffs on imports by companies that offshore jobs. He advocated a largely non-interventionist approach to foreign policy while increasing military spending, extreme vetting or banning immigrants from Muslim-majority countries[176] to pre-empt domestic Islamic terrorism, and aggressive military action against the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant. He described NATO as "obsolete".[177][178]

Trump helped bring far-right fringe ideas, beliefs, and organizations into the mainstream.[179] Trump was slow to disavow an endorsement from David Duke after he was questioned about it during a CNN interview on February 28, 2016.[180] Duke enthusiastically supported Trump and said he and like-minded people voted for Trump because of his promises to "take our country back".[181][182] In August 2016, Trump hired Steve Bannon, the executive chairman of Breitbart News—described by Bannon as "the platform for the alt-right"—as his campaign CEO.[183] The alt-right movement coalesced around and supported Trump's candidacy, due in part to its opposition to multiculturalism and immigration.[184][185][186] In an interview after the election, Trump said, "I don’t want to energize the [alt right], and I disavow the group."[187][188]

Financial disclosures
Further information: Tax returns of Donald Trump
Trump's FEC-required reports listed assets above $1.4 billion and outstanding debts of at least $315 million.[34][189] Trump did not release his tax returns, contrary to the practice of every major candidate since 1976 and his promises in 2014 and 2015 to do so if he ran for office.[190][191] He said his tax returns were being audited, and his lawyers had advised him against releasing them.[192] After a lengthy court battle to block release of his tax returns and other records to the Manhattan district attorney for a criminal investigation, including two appeals by Trump to the United States Supreme Court, in February 2021 the high court allowed the records to be released to the prosecutor for review by a grand jury.[193][194]

In October 2016, portions of Trump's state filings for 1995 were leaked to a reporter from The New York Times. They show that Trump had declared a loss of $916 million that year, which could have let him avoid taxes for up to 18 years.[195]

2016 electoral vote results. Trump won 304–227.
On November 8, 2016, Trump received 306 pledged electoral votes versus 232 for Clinton. The official counts were 304 and 227 respectively, after defections on both sides.[196] Trump received nearly 2.9 million fewer popular votes than Clinton, which made him the fifth person to be elected president while losing the popular vote.[197] Trump also became the only president who neither served in the military nor held any government office prior to becoming president.[198] Trump's victory was a political upset.[199] Polls had consistently shown Clinton with a nationwide—though diminishing—lead, as well as an advantage in most of the competitive states. Trump's support had been modestly underestimated, while Clinton's had been overestimated.[200]

Trump won 30 states, including Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin, which had been part of what was considered a blue wall of Democratic strongholds since the 1990s. Clinton won 20 states and the District of Columbia. Trump's victory marked the return of an undivided Republican government—a Republican White House combined with Republican control of both chambers of Congress.[201]

Trump's election victory sparked protests in major U.S. cities in the days following the election.[202][203] On the day after Trump's inauguration, an estimated 2.6 million people worldwide, including an estimated half million in Washington, D.C., protested against Trump in the Women's Marches.[204]
