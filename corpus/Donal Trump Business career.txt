Starting in 1968, Trump was employed at his father Fred's real estate company, Trump Management, which owned middle-class rental housing in New York City's outer boroughs.[48] In 1971, he became president of the company and began using the Trump Organization as an umbrella brand.[49]

Manhattan developments
Trump attracted public attention in 1978 with the launch of his family's first Manhattan venture, the renovation of the derelict Commodore Hotel, adjacent to Grand Central Terminal. The financing was facilitated by a $400 million city property tax abatement arranged by Fred Trump,[50] who also, jointly with Hyatt, guaranteed a $70 million in bank construction financing.[51] The hotel reopened in 1980 as the Grand Hyatt Hotel,[52] and that same year, Trump obtained rights to develop Trump Tower, a mixed-use skyscraper in Midtown Manhattan.[53] The building houses the headquarters of the Trump Corporation and Trump's PAC and was Trump's primary residence until 2019.[54][55]

In 1988, Trump acquired the Plaza Hotel in Manhattan with a loan of $425 million (equivalent to $974 million in 2021)[32] from a consortium of banks. Two years later, the hotel filed for bankruptcy protection, and a reorganization plan was approved in 1992.[56] In 1995, Trump sold the Plaza Hotel along with most of his properties to pay down his debts, including personally guaranteed loans, allowing him to avoid personal insolvency.[57][58]

In 1996, Trump acquired the mostly vacant 71-story skyscraper at 40 Wall Street, later rebranded as the Trump Building, and renovated it.[59] In the early 1990s, Trump won the right to develop a 70-acre (28 ha) tract in the Lincoln Square neighborhood near the Hudson River. Struggling with debt from other ventures in 1994, Trump sold most of his interest in the project to Asian investors, who were able to finance the project's completion, Riverside South.[60]

Mar-a-Lago

In 1985, Trump acquired the Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Florida.[61] In 1995, he converted the estate into a private club with an initiation fee and annual dues. He continued to use a wing of the house as a private residence.[62] In 2019, Trump declared Mar-a-Lago his primary residence.[55]

Atlantic City casinos

In 1984, Trump opened Harrah's at Trump Plaza, a hotel and casino in Atlantic City, New Jersey, with financing and management help from the Holiday Corporation.[63] It was unprofitable, and Trump paid Holiday $70 million in May 1986 to take sole control.[64] Trump had earlier bought a hotel and casino in Atlantic City from the Hilton Corporation for $320 million. On completion in 1985, it became Trump Castle. His wife Ivana managed it until 1988.[65][66]

Trump bought a third Atlantic City venue in 1988, the Trump Taj Mahal. It was financed with $675 million in junk bonds and completed for $1.1 billion, opening in April 1990.[67][68] Trump filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in 1991.[69] He was forced to give up half his initial stake and to personally guarantee future performance.[70] To reduce his $900 million of personal debt, he sold his failing Trump Shuttle airline; his megayacht, the Trump Princess, which had been leased to his casinos and kept docked; and other businesses.[71]

In 1995, Trump founded Trump Hotels & Casino Resorts (THCR), which assumed ownership of Trump Plaza; Trump Castle; and the Trump Casino in Gary, Indiana.[72] THCR purchased the Taj Mahal in 1996 and went bankrupt in 2004, 2009, and 2014, leaving Trump with 10 percent ownership.[73] He remained chairman until 2009.[74]

Golf courses

The Trump Organization began building and buying golf courses in 1999.[75] It owns fourteen and manages another three Trump-branded courses worldwide.[75][76]

Trump visited a Trump Organization property on 428 (nearly 1 in 3) of the 1,461 days of his presidency and is estimated to have played 261 rounds of golf, one every 5.6 days.[77]

Licensing of the Trump brand
See also: List of things named after Donald Trump
The Trump name has been licensed for various consumer products and services, including foodstuffs, apparel, adult learning courses, and home furnishings.[78][79] According to an analysis by The Washington Post, there are more than 50 licensing or management deals involving Trump's name, and they have generated at least $59 million in revenue for his companies.[80] By 2018, only two consumer goods companies continued to license his name.[78]

Side ventures

In September 1983, Trump purchased the New Jersey Generals, a team in the United States Football League. After the 1985 season, the league folded, largely due to Trump's strategy of moving games to a fall schedule (when they competed with the NFL for audience) and trying to force a merger with the NFL by bringing an antitrust suit against the organization.[81][82]

Trump's businesses have hosted several boxing matches at the Atlantic City Convention Hall, adjacent to and promoted as taking place at the Trump Plaza in Atlantic City.[83][84] In 1989 and 1990, Trump lent his name to the Tour de Trump cycling stage race, which was an attempt to create an American equivalent of European races such as the Tour de France or the Giro d'Italia.[85]

From 1986 to 1988, Trump purchased significant blocks of shares in various public companies while suggesting that he intended to take over the company and then sold his shares for a profit,[44] leading some observers to think he was engaged in greenmail.[86] The New York Times found that Trump initially made millions of dollars in such stock transactions, but later "lost most, if not all, of those gains after investors stopped taking his takeover talk seriously".[44]

In 1988, Trump purchased the Eastern Air Lines Shuttle, with 21 planes and landing rights in New York City, Boston, and Washington, D.C. He financed the purchase with $380 million (equivalent to $871 million in 2021)[32] from 22 banks, rebranded the operation the Trump Shuttle, and operated it until 1992. Trump failed to earn a profit with the airline and sold it to USAir.[87]

In 1992, Trump, his siblings Maryanne, Elizabeth, and Robert, and his cousin John W. Walter, each with a 20 percent share, formed All County Building Supply & Maintenance Corp. The company had no offices and is alleged to have been a shell company for paying the vendors providing services and supplies for Trump's rental units, then billing those services and supplies to Trump Management with markups of 20–50 percent and more. The owners shared the proceeds generated by the markups.[40][88] The increased costs were used as justification to get state approval for increasing the rents of Trump's rent-stabilized units.[40]

From 1996 to 2015, Trump owned all or part of the Miss Universe pageants, including Miss USA and Miss Teen USA.[89][90] Due to disagreements with CBS about scheduling, he took both pageants to NBC in 2002.[91][92] In 2007, Trump received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for his work as producer of Miss Universe.[93] NBC and Univision dropped the pageants from their broadcasting lineups in June 2015.[94]

Trump University
Main article: Trump University
In 2004, Trump co-founded Trump University, a company that sold real estate training courses priced from $1,500 to $35,000.[95] After New York State authorities notified the company that its use of the word "university" violated state law (as it was not an academic institution), its name was changed to the Trump Entrepreneur Initiative in 2010.[96]

In 2013, the State of New York filed a $40 million civil suit against Trump University, alleging that the company made false statements and defrauded consumers.[97] In addition, two class actions were filed in federal court against Trump and his companies. Internal documents revealed that employees were instructed to use a hard-sell approach, and former employees testified that Trump University had defrauded or lied to its students.[98][99][100] Shortly after he won the 2016 presidential election, Trump agreed to pay a total of $25 million to settle the three cases.[101]

Foundation
Main article: Donald J. Trump Foundation
The Donald J. Trump Foundation was a private foundation established in 1988.[102][103] In the foundation's final years its funds mostly came from donors other than Trump, who did not donate any personal funds to the charity from 2009 until 2014.[104] The foundation gave to health care and sports-related charities, as well as conservative groups.[105]

In 2016, The Washington Post reported that the charity had committed several potential legal and ethical violations, including alleged self-dealing and possible tax evasion.[106] Also in 2016, the New York State attorney general's office said the foundation appeared to be in violation of New York laws regarding charities and ordered it to immediately cease its fundraising activities in New York.[107][108] Trump's team announced in December 2016 that the foundation would be dissolved.[109]

In June 2018, the New York attorney general's office filed a civil suit against the foundation, Trump, and his adult children, seeking $2.8 million in restitution and additional penalties.[110][111] In December 2018, the foundation ceased operation and disbursed all its assets to other charities.[112] In November 2019, a New York state judge ordered Trump to pay $2 million to a group of charities for misusing the foundation's funds, in part to finance his presidential campaign.[113][114]

Legal affairs and bankruptcies
Main article: Legal affairs of Donald Trump
Trump and his businesses had been involved in more than 4,000 state and federal legal actions, according to a running tally by USA Today.[115]

Roy Cohn was Trump's fixer, lawyer and mentor for 13 years in the 1970s and 1980s.[116] According to Trump, Cohn sometimes waived fees due to their friendship.[116] In 1973, Cohn helped Trump countersue the United States government for $100 million (equivalent to $610 million in 2021)[32] over its charges that Trump's properties had racial discriminatory practices. Trump's counterclaims were dismissed, and the government's case went forward, ultimately resulting in a settlement.[117] In 1975, an agreement was struck requiring Trump's properties to furnish the New York Urban League with a list of all apartment vacancies, every week for two years, among other things.[118] Cohn introduced political consultant Roger Stone to Trump, who enlisted Stone's services to deal with the federal government.[119]

While Trump has not filed for personal bankruptcy, his over-leveraged hotel and casino businesses in Atlantic City and New York filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection six times between 1991 and 2009.[120] They continued to operate while the banks restructured debt and reduced Trump's shares in the properties.[120]

During the 1980s, more than 70 banks had lent Trump $4 billion,[121] but in the aftermath of his corporate bankruptcies of the early 1990s, most major banks declined to lend to him, with only Deutsche Bank still willing to lend money.[122] After the January 6 United States Capitol attack, the bank decided not to do business with Trump or his company in the future.[123]
