Speculation and announcement

Between 2016 and 2019, media outlets often mentioned Biden as a likely candidate for president in 2020.[272] When asked if he would run, he gave varied and ambivalent answers, saying "never say never".[273] A political action committee known as Time for Biden was formed in January 2018, seeking Biden's entry into the race.[274] He finally launched his campaign on April 25, 2019,[275] saying he was prompted to run becuse he was worried by the Trump administration and felt a "sense of duty".[276]

Campaign
As the 2020 campaign season heated up, voluminous public polling showed Biden as one of the best-performing Democratic candidates in a head-to-head matchup against President Trump.[277][278][279] With Democrats keenly focused on "electability" for defeating Trump,[280] this boosted his popularity among Democratic voters.[281] It also made Biden a frequent target of Trump.[282][283] In September 2019, it was reported that Trump had pressured Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy to investigate alleged wrongdoing by Biden and his son Hunter Biden.[284] Despite the allegations, no evidence was produced of any wrongdoing by the Bidens.[285][286][287] Trump's pressure to investigate the Bidens was perceived by many as an attempt to hurt Biden's chances of winning the presidency.[288] Trump's alleged actions against Biden resulted in a political scandal[289] and Trump's impeachment by the House of Representatives for abuse of power and obstruction of congress.[290]

In March 2019 and April 2019, eight women accused Biden of previous instances of inappropriate physical contact, such as embracing, touching or kissing.[291] Biden had previously called himself a "tactile politician" and admitted this behavior had caused trouble for him.[292] Journalist Mark Bowden described Biden's lifelong habit of talking close, writing that he "doesn't just meet you, he engulfs you... scooting closer" and leaning forward to talk.[293] In April 2019, Biden pledged to be more "respectful of people's personal space".[294]

Throughout 2019, Biden stayed generally ahead of other Democrats in national polls.[295][296] Despite this, he finished fourth in the Iowa caucuses, and eight days later, fifth in the New Hampshire primary.[297][298] He performed better in the Nevada caucuses, reaching the 15% required for delegates, but still finished 21.6 percentage points behind Bernie Sanders.[299] Making strong appeals to Black voters on the campaign trail and in the South Carolina debate, Biden won the South Carolina primary by more than 28 points.[300] After the withdrawals and subsequent endorsements of candidates Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar, he made large gains in the March 3 Super Tuesday primary elections. Biden won 18 of the next 26 contests, putting him in the lead overall.[301] Elizabeth Warren and Mike Bloomberg soon dropped out, and Biden expanded his lead with victories over Sanders in four states on March 10.[302]

In late March 2020, Tara Reade, one of the eight women who in 2019 had accused Biden of inappropriate physical contact, accused Biden of having sexually assaulted her in 1993.[303] There were inconsistencies between Reade's 2019 and 2020 allegations.[303][304] Biden and his campaign denied the sexual assault allegation.[305][306]

When Sanders suspended his campaign on April 8, 2020, Biden became the Democratic Party's presumptive nominee for president.[307] On April 13, Sanders endorsed Biden in a live-streamed discussion from their homes.[308] Former President Barack Obama endorsed Biden the next day.[309] On August 11, Biden announced U.S. Senator Kamala Harris of California as his running mate, making her the first African American and first South Asian American vice-presidential nominee on a major-party ticket.[310] On August 18, 2020, Biden was officially nominated at the 2020 Democratic National Convention as the Democratic Party nominee for president in the 2020 election.[311][312]

Presidential transition

Biden was elected the 46th president of the United States in November 2020. He defeated the incumbent, Donald Trump, becoming the first candidate to defeat a sitting president since Bill Clinton defeated George H. W. Bush in 1992. Trump refused to concede, insisting the election had been "stolen" from him through "voter fraud", challenging the results in court and promoting numerous conspiracy theories about the voting and vote-counting processes, in an attempt to overturn the election results.[313] Biden's transition was delayed by several weeks as the White House ordered federal agencies not to cooperate.[314] On November 23, General Services Administrator Emily W. Murphy formally recognized Biden as the apparent winner of the 2020 election and authorized the start of a transition process to the Biden administration.[315]

On January 6, 2021, during Congress' electoral vote count, Trump told supporters gathered in front of the White House to march to the Capitol, saying, "We will never give up. We will never concede. It doesn't happen. You don't concede when there's theft involved."[316] Soon after, they attacked the Capitol. During the insurrection at the Capitol, Biden addressed the nation, calling the events "an unprecedented assault unlike anything we've seen in modern times".[317][318] After the Capitol was cleared, Congress resumed its joint session and officially certified the election results with Vice President Mike Pence, in his capacity as President of the Senate, declaring Biden and Harris the winners.[319]
