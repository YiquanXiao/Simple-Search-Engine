Joseph Robinette Biden Jr. was born on November 20, 1942,[1] at St. Mary's Hospital in Scranton, Pennsylvania,[2] to Catherine Eugenia "Jean" Biden (n√©e Finnegan) and Joseph Robinette Biden Sr.[3][4] The oldest child in a Catholic family, he has a sister, Valerie, and two brothers, Francis and James.[5] Jean was of Irish descent,[6][7][8] while Joseph Sr. had English, Irish, and French Huguenot ancestry.[9][10][8] Biden's paternal line has been traced to stonemason William Biden, who was born in 1789 in Westbourne, England, and emigrated to Maryland in the United States by 1820.[11]

Biden's father had been wealthy and the family purchased a home in the affluent Long Island suburb of Garden City in the fall of 1946,[12] but he suffered business setbacks around the time Biden was seven years old,[13][14][15] and for several years the family lived with Biden's maternal grandparents in Scranton.[16] Scranton fell into economic decline during the 1950s and Biden's father could not find steady work.[17] Beginning in 1953 when Biden was ten,[18] the family lived in an apartment in Claymont, Delaware, before moving to a house in nearby Mayfield.[19][20][14][16] Biden Sr. later became a successful used-car salesman, maintaining the family in a middle-class lifestyle.[16][17][21]

At Archmere Academy in Claymont,[22] Biden played baseball and was a standout halfback and wide receiver on the high school football team.[16][23] Though a poor student, he was class president in his junior and senior years.[24][25] He graduated in 1961.[24] At the University of Delaware in Newark, Biden briefly played freshman football,[26][27] and, as an unexceptional student,[28] earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1965 with a double major in history and political science.[29][30]

Biden has a stutter, which has improved since his early twenties.[31] Biden has described his efforts to reduce it by reciting poetry before a mirror.[25][32]
