Trump was inaugurated on January 20, 2017. During his first week in office, he signed six executive orders, which authorized: interim procedures in anticipation of repealing the Affordable Care Act ("Obamacare"), withdrawal from the Trans-Pacific Partnership negotiations, reinstatement of the Mexico City policy, advancement of the Keystone XL and Dakota Access Pipeline construction projects, reinforcement of border security, and a planning and design process to construct a wall along the U.S. border with Mexico.[205]

Trump's daughter Ivanka and son-in-law Jared Kushner became his assistant and senior advisor, respectively.[206][207]

Conflicts of interest
Before being inaugurated, Trump moved his businesses into a revocable trust run by his sons, Eric and Donald Jr., and a business associate.[208][209] He continued to profit from his businesses[210] and to know how his administration's policies affected his businesses.[209] Though Trump said he would eschew "new foreign deals", the Trump Organization pursued expansions of its operations in Dubai, Scotland, and the Dominican Republic.[210]

Trump was sued for violating the Domestic and Foreign Emoluments Clauses of the U.S. Constitution, marking the first time that the clauses had been substantively litigated.[211][212] The plaintiffs said that Trump's business interests could allow foreign governments to influence him.[212][210][213][211] After Trump's term ended, the U.S. Supreme Court dismissed the cases as moot.[214]

Trump took office at the height of the longest economic expansion in American history,[215] which began in June 2009 and continued until February 2020, when the COVID-19 recession began.[216]

In December 2017, Trump signed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. The bill had been passed by both Republican-controlled chambers of Congress without any Democratic votes. It reduced tax rates for businesses and individuals, with business tax cuts to be permanent and individual tax cuts set to expire after 2025, and eliminated the penalty associated with Affordable Care Act's individual mandate.[217][218] The Trump administration claimed that the act would either increase tax revenues or pay for itself by prompting economic growth. Instead, revenues in 2018 were 7.6 percent lower than projected.[219]

Despite a campaign promise to eliminate the national debt in eight years, Trump approved large increases in government spending and the 2017 tax cut. As a result, the federal budget deficit increased by almost 50 percent, to nearly $1 trillion in 2019.[220] Under Trump, the U.S. national debt increased by 39 percent, reaching $27.75 trillion by the end of his term, and the U.S. debt-to-GDP ratio hit a post-World War II high.[221] Trump also failed to deliver the $1 trillion infrastructure spending plan on which he had campaigned.[222]

Trump is the only modern U.S. president to leave office with a smaller workforce than when he took office, by 3 million people.[215]

Climate change, environment, and energy
Main article: Environmental policy of the Donald Trump administration
Trump rejects the scientific consensus on climate change.[223][224] He reduced the budget for renewable energy research by 40 percent and reversed Obama-era policies directed at curbing climate change.[225] In June 2017, Trump announced the withdrawal of the United States from the Paris Agreement, making the U.S. the only nation in the world to not ratify the agreement.[226]

Trump aimed to boost the production and exports of fossil fuels.[227][228] Natural gas expanded under Trump, but coal continued to decline.[229][230] Trump rolled back more than 100 federal environmental regulations, including those that curbed greenhouse gas emissions, air and water pollution, and the use of toxic substances. He weakened protections for animals and environmental standards for federal infrastructure projects, and expanded permitted areas for drilling and resource extraction, such as allowing drilling in the Arctic Refuge. Trump's actions while president have been called "a very aggressive attempt to rewrite our laws and reinterpret the meaning of environmental protections".[231]

Deregulation
In January 2017, Trump signed Executive Order 13771, which directed that, for every new regulation, federal agencies "identify" two existing regulations for elimination, though it did not require elimination.[232] He dismantled many federal regulations on health,[233][234] labor,[235][234] and the environment,[236][234] among other topics. Trump signed 14 Congressional Review Act resolutions repealing federal regulations, including a bill that made it easier for severely mentally ill persons to buy guns.[237] During his first six weeks in office, he delayed, suspended, or reversed ninety federal regulations,[238] often "after requests by the regulated industries".[239] The Institute for Policy Integrity found that 78 percent of Trump's proposals were blocked by courts or did not prevail over litigation.[240]

Health care
During his campaign, Trump vowed to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act (ACA).[241] In office, he scaled back the Act's implementation through executive orders 13765[242] and 13813.[243] Trump expressed a desire to "let Obamacare fail"; his administration cut the ACA enrollment period in half and drastically reduced funding for advertising and other ways to encourage enrollment.[244][245] Trump falsely claimed he saved the coverage of pre-existing conditions provided by the ACA.[246] In June 2018, the Trump administration joined 18 Republican-led states in arguing before the Supreme Court that the elimination of the financial penalties associated with the individual mandate had rendered the ACA unconstitutional.[247][248] If they had succeeded, it would have eliminated health insurance coverage for up to 23 million Americans.[247] During the 2016 campaign, Trump promised to protect funding for Medicare and other social safety-net programs, but in January 2020, he suggested he was willing to consider cuts to such programs.[249]

In response to the opioid epidemic, Trump signed legislation in 2018 to increase funding for drug treatments, but was widely criticized for failing to make a concrete strategy. U.S. opioid overdose deaths declined slightly in 2018, but surged to a record 50,052 deaths in 2019.[250]

Social issues
Main article: Social policy of Donald Trump
Trump said in 2016 that he was committed to appointing "pro-life" justices who would "automatically" overturn Roe v. Wade.[251] He also said he supported "traditional marriage" but considered the nationwide legality of same-sex marriage a "settled" issue;[252] in March 2017, his administration rolled back key components of the Obama administration's workplace protections against discrimination of LGBT people.[253]

Trump has said he is opposed to gun control in general, although his views have shifted over time.[254] After several mass shootings during his term, he said he would propose legislation to curtail gun violence, but he abandoned that effort in November 2019.[255] His administration took an anti-marijuana position, revoking Obama-era policies that provided protections for states that legalized marijuana.[256]

Trump is a long-time advocate of capital punishment.[257][258] Under his administration, the federal government executed 13 prisoners, more than in the previous 56 years combined and after a 17-year moratorium.[259] In 2016, Trump said he supported the use of interrogation torture methods such as waterboarding[260][261] but later appeared to recant this due to the opposition of Defense Secretary James Mattis.[262]

Pardons and commutations
Further information: List of people granted executive clemency by Donald Trump
Most of Trump's pardons and commutations were granted to people with personal or political connections to him.[263] In his term, Trump sidestepped regular Department of Justice procedures for considering pardons; instead, he often entertained pardon requests from his associates or celebrities.[263]

From 2017 to 2019, he pardoned, amongst others, former Arizona sheriff Joe Arpaio;[264] former Navy sailor Kristian Saucier, who was convicted of taking classified photographs of classified areas inside a submarine;[265] and right-wing commentator Dinesh D'Souza.[266] Following a request by celebrity Kim Kardashian, Trump commuted the life sentence of Alice Marie Johnson, who had been convicted of drug trafficking.[267] Trump also pardoned or reversed the sentences of three American servicemen convicted or accused of committing war crimes in Afghanistan or Iraq.[268]

In November and December 2020, Trump pardoned four Blackwater private security contractors convicted of killing Iraqi civilians in the 2007 Nisour Square massacre;[269] white-collar criminals Michael Milken and Bernard Kerik;[270] and daughter Ivanka's father-in-law Charles Kushner.[263] He also pardoned five people convicted as a result of investigations into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential elections: Michael Flynn, George Papadopoulos, Alex van der Zwaan,[269] Stone, whose 40-month sentence for lying to Congress, witness tampering, and obstruction he had already commuted in July, and Paul Manafort.[271]

In his last full day in office, Trump granted 143 pardons and commutations; those receiving pardons include Steve Bannon, Trump fundraiser Elliott Broidy, and three former Republican congressmen.[b] Amongst those to receive sentence commutation were former Detroit mayor and Democrat Kwame Kilpatrick and sports gambler Billy Walters; the latter had paid tens of thousands of dollars to former Trump attorney John M. Dowd to plead his case with Trump.[272]

Lafayette Square protester removal and photo op
Main article: Donald Trump photo op at St. John's Church

On June 1, 2020, federal law-enforcement officials used batons, rubber bullets, pepper spray projectiles, stun grenades, and smoke to remove a largely peaceful crowd of protesters from Lafayette Square, outside the White House.[273][274] Trump then walked to St. John's Episcopal Church, where protesters had set a small fire the night before; he posed for photographs holding a Bible, with senior administration officials later joining him in photos.[273][275] Trump said on June 3 that the protesters were cleared because "they tried to burn down the church [on May 31] and almost succeeded", describing the church as "badly hurt".[276]

Religious leaders condemned the treatment of protesters and the photo opportunity itself.[277] Many retired military leaders and defense officials condemned Trump's proposal to use the U.S. military against anti-police-brutality protesters.[278]

Immigration
Main article: Immigration policy of Donald Trump
Trump's proposed immigration policies were a topic of bitter and contentious debate during the campaign. He promised to build a wall on the Mexico–United States border to restrict illegal movement and vowed Mexico would pay for it.[279] He pledged to deport millions of illegal immigrants residing in the United States,[280] and criticized birthright citizenship for incentivizing "anchor babies".[281] As president, he frequently described illegal immigration as an "invasion" and conflated immigrants with the criminal gang MS-13,[282] though available research shows undocumented immigrants have a lower crime rate than native-born Americans.[283][284]

Trump attempted to drastically escalate immigration enforcement, including implementing harsher immigration enforcement policies against asylum seekers from Central America than any modern U.S. president.[285][286]

From 2018 onward, Trump deployed nearly 6,000 troops to the U.S.–Mexico border[287] to stop most Central American migrants from seeking U.S. asylum. In 2020, his administration widened the public charge rule to further restrict immigrants who might use government benefits from getting permanent residency via green cards.[288] Trump reduced the number of refugees admitted into the U.S. to record lows. When Trump took office, the annual limit was 110,000; Trump set a limit of 18,000 in the 2020 fiscal year and 15,000 in the 2021 fiscal year.[289][290] Additional restrictions implemented by the Trump administration caused significant bottlenecks in processing refugee applications, resulting in fewer refugees accepted compared to the allowed limits.[291]

Travel ban
Main article: Trump travel ban
Further information: Executive Order 13769 and Executive Order 13780
Following the 2015 San Bernardino attack, Trump proposed to ban Muslim foreigners from entering the United States until stronger vetting systems could be implemented.[292] He later reframed the proposed ban to apply to countries with a "proven history of terrorism".[293]

On January 27, 2017, Trump signed Executive Order 13769, which suspended admission of refugees for 120 days and denied entry to citizens of Iraq, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen for 90 days, citing security concerns. The order took effect immediately and without warning, causing confusion and chaos at airports.[294][295] Protests against the ban began at airports the next day.[294][295] Legal challenges to the order resulted in nationwide preliminary injunctions.[296] A March 6 revised order, which excluded Iraq and gave other exemptions, again was blocked by federal judges in three states.[297][298] In a decision in June 2017, the Supreme Court ruled that the ban could be enforced on visitors who lack a "credible claim of a bona fide relationship with a person or entity in the United States".[299]

The temporary order was replaced by Presidential Proclamation 9645 on September 24, 2017, which restricted travel from the originally targeted countries except Iraq and Sudan, and further banned travelers from North Korea and Chad, along with certain Venezuelan officials.[300] After lower courts partially blocked the new restrictions, the Supreme Court allowed the September version to go into full effect on December 4, 2017,[301] and ultimately upheld the travel ban in a June 2019 ruling.[302]

Family separation at border
Main article: Trump administration family separation policy

The Trump administration separated more than 5,400 children of migrant families from their parents at the U.S.–Mexico border while attempting to enter the U.S, a sharp increase in the number of family separations at the border starting from the summer of 2017.[303][304] In April 2018, the Trump administration announced a "zero tolerance" policy whereby every adult suspected of illegal entry would be criminally prosecuted.[305] This resulted in family separations, as the migrant adults were put in criminal detention for prosecution, while their children were separated as unaccompanied alien minors.[306] Administration officials described the policy as a way to deter illegal immigration.[307]

The policy of family separations was unprecedented in previous administrations and sparked public outrage.[307][308] Trump falsely asserted that his administration was merely following the law, blaming Democrats, despite the separations being his administration's policy.[309][310][311]

Although Trump originally argued that the separations could not be stopped by an executive order, he accceded to intense public objection and signed an executive order on June 20, 2018, mandating that migrant families be detained together unless "there is a concern" doing so would pose a risk to the child.[312][313] On June 26, 2018, Judge Dana Sabraw concluded that the Trump administration had "no system in place to keep track of" the separated children, nor any effective measures for family communication and reunification;[314] Sabraw ordered for the families to be reunited and family separations stopped except in limited circumstances.[315] After the federal-court order, the Trump administration separated more than a thousand migrant children from their families; the ACLU contended that the Trump administration had abused its discretion and asked Sabraw to more narrowly define the circumstances warranting separation.[304]

One of Trump's central campaign promises was to build a 1,000-mile (1,600 km) border wall to Mexico and have Mexico pay for it.[316] By the end of his term, the U.S. had built "40 miles [64 km] of new primary wall and 33 miles [53 km] of secondary wall" in locations where there had been no barriers and 365 miles (587 km) of primary or secondary border fencing replacing dilapidated or outdated barriers.[317]

In 2018, Trump refused to extend government funding unless Congress allocated $5.6 billion in funds for the border wall,[318] resulting in the federal government partially shutting down for 35 days from December 2018 to January 2019, the longest U.S. government shutdown in history.[319][320] Around 800,000 government employees were furloughed or worked without pay.[321] Trump and Congress ended the shutdown by approving temporary funding that provided delayed payments to government workers but no funds for the wall.[319] The shutdown resulted in an estimated permanent loss of $3 billion to the economy, according to the Congressional Budget Office.[322] About half of those polled blamed Trump for the shutdown, and Trump's approval ratings dropped.[323]

To prevent another imminent shutdown in February 2019, Congress passed and Trump signed a funding bill that included $1.375 billion for 55 miles (89 km) of bollard border fencing.[324] Trump also declared a National Emergency Concerning the Southern Border of the United States, intending to divert $6.1 billion of funds Congress had allocated to other purposes.[324] Trump vetoed a joint resolution to overturn the declaration, and the Senate voted against a veto override.[325] Legal challenges to the diversion of $2.5 billion originally meant for the Department of Defense's drug interdiction efforts[326][327] and $3.6 billion originally meant for military construction[328][329]

See also: List of international presidential trips made by Donald Trump

Trump described himself as a "nationalist"[330] and his foreign policy as "America First".[331] He espoused isolationist, non-interventionist, and protectionist views.[332][333] His foreign policy was marked by praise and support of populist, neo-nationalist and authoritarian governments.[334] Hallmarks of foreign relations during Trump's tenure included unpredictability and uncertainty,[331] a lack of a consistent foreign policy,[335] and strained and sometimes antagonistic relationships with the U.S.'s European allies.[336]

Trump questioned the need for NATO,[332] criticized the U.S.'s NATO allies, and privately suggested on multiple occasions that the United States should withdraw from the alliance.[337][338]

Trade
See also: Trump tariffs
In the 1980s, Trump publicly announced his skepticism of trade liberalization, saying, "I believe very strongly in tariffs." In 2015, he sharply criticized NAFTA during the Republican primary campaign.[339][340] During his presidency, Trump withdrew the U.S. from the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) negotiations,[341] imposed tariffs on steel and aluminum imports,[342] and launched a trade war with China by sharply increasing tariffs on 818 categories (worth $50 billion) of Chinese goods imported into the U.S.[343] While Trump said that import tariffs are paid by China into the U.S. Treasury, they are paid by American companies that import goods from China.[344] Although he pledged during the campaign to significantly reduce the U.S.'s large trade deficits, the trade deficit in July 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, "was the largest monthly deficit since July 2008".[345] Following a 2017–2018 renegotiation, the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) became effective in July 2020 as the successor to NAFTA.[346]

Russia

The Trump administration "water[ed] down the toughest penalties the U.S. had imposed on Russian entities" after its 2014 annexation of Crimea.[347][348] Trump withdrew the U.S. from the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, citing alleged Russian non-compliance,[349] and supported a potential return of Russia to the G7.[350]

Trump repeatedly praised and rarely criticized Russian president Vladimir Putin,[351][352] but opposed some actions of the Russian government.[353][354] After he met Putin at the Helsinki Summit in July 2018, Trump drew bipartisan criticism for accepting Putin's denial of Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election, rather than accepting the findings of U.S. intelligence agencies.[355][356][357] Trump did not discuss alleged Russian bounties offered to Taliban fighters for attacking American soldiers in Afghanistan with Putin, saying both that he doubted the intelligence and that he was not briefed on it.[358]

China
Before and during his presidency, Trump repeatedly accused China of taking unfair advantage of the U.S.[359] As president, Trump launched a trade war against China that was widely characterized as a failure;[360][361][362] sanctioned Huawei for its alleged ties to Iran;[363] significantly increased visa restrictions on Chinese students and scholars;[364] and classified China as a currency manipulator.[365] Trump also juxtaposed verbal attacks on China with praise of Chinese Communist Party leader Xi Jinping,[366] which was attributed to trade war negotiations with the leader.[367] After initially praising China for its handling of the COVID-19 pandemic,[368] he began a campaign of criticism over its response starting in March 2020.[369]

Trump said he resisted punishing China for its human rights abuses against ethnic minorities in the northwestern Xinjiang region for fear of jeopardizing trade negotiations.[370] In July 2020, the Trump administration imposed sanctions and visa restrictions against senior Chinese officials, in response to expanded mass detention camps holding more than a million of the country's Uyghur Muslim ethnic minority.[371]

North Korea

In 2017, when North Korea's nuclear weapons were increasingly seen as a serious threat,[372] Trump escalated his rhetoric, warning that North Korean aggression would be met with "fire and fury like the world has never seen".[373][374] In 2017, Trump declared that he wanted North Korea's "complete denuclearization", and engaged in name-calling with leader Kim Jong Un.[373][375]

After this period of tension, Trump and Kim exchanged at least 27 letters in which the two men described a warm personal friendship.[376][377] Trump met Kim three times: in Singapore in 2018, in Hanoi in 2019, and in the Korean Demilitarized Zone in 2019.[378] Trump became the first sitting U.S. president to meet a North Korean leader or to set foot on North Korean soil.[378] Trump also lifted some U.S. sanctions against North Korea.[379]

However, no denuclearization agreement was reached,[380] and talks in October 2019 broke down after one day.[381] While conducting no nuclear tests since 2017, North Korea continued to build up its arsenal of nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles.[382][383]

Afghanistan

U.S. troop numbers in Afghanistan increased from 8,500 in January 2017 to 14,000 a year later,[384] reversing Trump's pre-election position critical of further involvement in Afghanistan.[385] In February 2020, the Trump administration signed a conditional peace agreement with the Taliban, which called for the withdrawal of foreign troops in 14 months "contingent on a guarantee from the Taliban that Afghan soil will not be used by terrorists with aims to attack the United States or its allies" and for the U.S. to seek the release of 5,000 Taliban imprisoned by the Afghan government.[386][387][388] By the end of Trump's term, 5,000 Taliban had been released, and, despite the Taliban continuing attacks on Afghan forces and integrating Al-Qaeda members into its leadership, U.S. troops had been reduced to 2,500.[388]

Israel
Trump supported many of the policies of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.[389] Under Trump, the U.S. recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel[390] and Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights,[391] leading to international condemnation including from the United Nations General Assembly, the European Union, and the Arab League.[392][393]

Saudi Arabia
Trump actively supported the Saudi Arabian–led intervention in Yemen against the Houthis and in 2017 signed a $110 billion agreement to sell arms to Saudi Arabia,[394] In 2018, the USA provided limited intelligence and logistical support for the intervention.[395][396] Following the 2019 attack on Saudi oil facilities, which the U.S. and Saudi Arabia blamed on Iran, Trump approved the deployment of 3,000 additional U.S. troops, including fighter squadrons, two Patriot batteries, and a Terminal High Altitude Area Defense system (THAAD), to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.[397]

Syria
Trump ordered missile strikes in April 2017 and in April 2018 against the Assad regime in Syria, in retaliation for the Khan Shaykhun and Douma chemical attacks, respectively.[398][399]

In December 2018, Trump declared "we have won against ISIS", contradicting Department of Defense assessments, and ordered the withdrawal of all troops from Syria.[400][401] The next day, Mattis resigned in protest, calling his decision an abandonment of the U.S.'s Kurdish allies who played a key role in fighting ISIS.[402] One week after his announcement, Trump said he would not approve any extension of the American deployment in Syria.[403]


Trump and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan at the White House in May 2017
In October 2019, after Trump spoke to Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, U.S. troops in northern Syria were withdrawn from the area and Turkey invaded northern Syria, attacking and displacing American-allied Kurds in the area.[404] Later that month, the U.S. House of Representatives, in a rare bipartisan vote of 354 to 60, condemned Trump's withdrawal of U.S. troops from Syria, for "abandoning U.S. allies, undermining the struggle against ISIS, and spurring a humanitarian catastrophe".[405][406]

Iran
After an Iranian missile test on January 29, 2017, and Houthi attacks on Saudi warships, the Trump administration sanctioned 12 companies and 13 individuals suspected of being involved in Iran's missile program.[407] In May 2018, Trump withdrew the United States from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), the 2015 agreement between Iran, the U.S., and five other countries that lifted most economic sanctions against Iran in return for Iran agreeing to restrictions on its nuclear program.[408][409] Analysts determined that, after the United States's withdrawal, Iran moved closer to developing a nuclear weapon.[410]

In January 2020, Trump ordered a U.S. airstrike that killed Iranian general Qasem Soleimani, who had planned nearly every significant operation by Iranian forces over the past two decades.[411] Trump threatened to hit 52 Iranian sites, including some "important to Iran & the Iranian culture", if Iran retaliated.[412] The threat to hit cultural sites was seen as illegal and both Defense Secretary Mark Esper and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said that the U.S. would not attack such sites, but would "follow the laws of armed conflict" and "behave inside the system".[413] Iran did retaliate with ballistic missile strikes against two U.S. airbases in Iraq.[410] On the same day, amid the heightened tensions between the United States and Iran, Iran accidentally[414] shot down Ukraine International Airlines Flight 752 after takeoff from Tehran airport.[415][414][416]

In August 2020, the Trump administration unsuccessfully attempted to trigger a mechanism that was part of the agreement that would have led to the return of U.N. sanctions against Iran.[417]

Personnel
Main articles: Political appointments by Donald Trump and Cabinet of Donald Trump
The Trump administration had a high turnover of personnel, particularly among White House staff. By the end of Trump's first year in office, 34 percent of his original staff had resigned, been fired, or been reassigned.[418] As of early July 2018, 61 percent of Trump's senior aides had left[419] and 141 staffers had left in the previous year.[420] Both figures set a record for recent presidents—more change in the first 13 months than his four immediate predecessors saw in their first two years.[421] Notable early departures included National Security Advisor Flynn (after just 25 days in office), and Press Secretary Sean Spicer.[421] Close personal aides to Trump including Bannon, Hope Hicks, John McEntee, and Keith Schiller quit or were forced out.[422] Some, including Hicks and McEntee, later returned to the White House in different posts.[423] Trump publicly disparaged several of his former top officials, calling them incompetent, stupid, or crazy.[424]

Trump had four White House chiefs of staff, marginalizing or pushing out several.[425] Reince Priebus was replaced after seven months by retired Marine general John F. Kelly.[426] Kelly resigned in December 2018 after a tumultuous tenure in which his influence waned, and Trump subsequently disparaged him.[427] Kelly was succeeded by Mick Mulvaney as acting chief of staff; he was replaced in March 2020 by Mark Meadows.[425]

On May 9, 2017, Trump dismissed FBI director James Comey. While initially attributing this action to Comey's conduct in the investigation about Hillary Clinton's emails, Trump said a few days later that he was concerned with Comey's roles in the ongoing Trump-Russia investigations, and that he had intended to fire Comey earlier.[428] At a private conversation in February, Trump said he hoped Comey would drop the investigation into Flynn.[429] In March and April, Trump asked Comey to "lift the cloud impairing his ability to act" by saying publicly that the FBI was not investigating him.[429][430]

Two of Trump's 15 original cabinet members were gone within 15 months. Health and Human Services secretary Tom Price was forced to resign in September 2017 due to excessive use of private charter jets and military aircraft.[431][422] Environmental Protection Agency administrator Scott Pruitt resigned in 2018 and Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke in January 2019 amid multiple investigations into their conduct.[432][433]

Trump was slow to appoint second-tier officials in the executive branch, saying many of the positions are unnecessary. In October 2017, there were still hundreds of sub-cabinet positions without a nominee.[434] By January 8, 2019, of 706 key positions, 433 had been filled (61 percent) and Trump had no nominee for 264 (37 percent).[435]

Trump appointed 226 Article III judges, including 54 to the courts of appeals and three to the Supreme Court: Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh, and Amy Coney Barrett.[436]

As president, Trump disparaged courts and judges whom he disagreed with, often in personal terms, and questioned the judiciary's constitutional authority. Trump's attacks on the courts drew rebukes from observers, including sitting federal judges, concerned about the effect of Trump's statements on the judicial independence and public confidence in the judiciary.[437][438][439]

In December 2019, COVID-19 erupted in Wuhan, China; the SARS-CoV-2 virus spread worldwide within weeks.[440][441] The first confirmed case in the U.S. was reported on January 20, 2020.[442] The outbreak was officially declared a public health emergency by Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Alex Azar on January 31, 2020.[443]

Trump's public statements on COVID-19 were at odds with his private statements. In February 2020 Trump publicly asserted that the outbreak in the U.S. was less deadly than influenza, was "very much under control", and would soon be over.[444] At the same time he acknowledged the opposite in a private conversation with Bob Woodward. In March 2020, Trump privately told Woodward that he was deliberately "playing it down" in public so as not to create panic.[445][446]

Initial response
Trump was slow to address the spread of the disease, initially dismissing the threat and ignoring persistent public health warnings and calls for action from health officials within his administration and Secretary Azar.[447][448] Throughout January and February he focused on economic and political considerations of the outbreak, and largely ignored the danger.[449] By mid-March, most global financial markets had severely contracted in response to the emerging pandemic.[450] Trump claimed that a vaccine was a few months to less than a year away, although HHS and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) officials had repeatedly told him that vaccine development would take 12–18 months.[451]

On March 6, Trump signed the Coronavirus Preparedness and Response Supplemental Appropriations Act into law, which provided $8.3 billion in emergency funding for federal agencies.[452] On March 11, the World Health Organization (WHO) recognized the spread of COVID-19 as a pandemic,[440] and Trump announced partial travel restrictions for most of Europe, effective March 13.[453] That same day, he gave his first serious assessment of the virus in a nationwide Oval Office address, calling the outbreak "horrible" but "a temporary moment" and saying there was no financial crisis.[454] On March 13, he declared a national emergency, freeing up federal resources.[455] Trump falsely claimed that "anybody that wants a test can get a test", despite the availability of tests being severely limited.[456]

In September 2019, the Trump administration terminated United States Agency for International Development's PREDICT program, a $200 million epidemiological research program initiated in 2009 to provide early warning of pandemics abroad.[457][458] The program trained scientists in sixty foreign laboratories to detect and respond to viruses that have the potential to cause pandemics. One such laboratory was the Wuhan lab that first identified the virus that causes COVID-19. After revival in April 2020, the program was given two 6-month extensions to help fight COVID-19 in the U.S. and other countries.[459][460]

On April 22, Trump signed an executive order restricting some forms of immigration to the United States.[461] In late spring and early summer, with infections and death counts continuing to rise, he adopted a strategy of blaming the states for the growing pandemic, rather than accepting that his initial assessments of the course of the pandemic were overly-optimistic or his failure to provide presidential leadership.[462]

White House Coronavirus Task Force

Trump established the White House Coronavirus Task Force on January 29, 2020.[463] Beginning in mid-March, Trump held a daily task force press conference, joined by medical experts and other administration officials,[464] sometimes disagreeing with them by promoting unproven treatments.[465] Trump was the main speaker at the briefings, where he praised his own response to the pandemic, frequently criticized rival presidential candidate Joe Biden, and denounced the press.[464][466] On March 16, he acknowledged for the first time that the pandemic was not under control and that months of disruption to daily lives and a recession might occur.[467] His repeated use of the terms "Chinese virus" and "China virus" to describe COVID-19 drew criticism from health experts.[468][469][470]

By early April, as the pandemic worsened and amid criticism of his administration's response, Trump refused to admit any mistakes in his handling of the outbreak, instead blaming the media, Democratic state governors, the previous administration, China, and the World Health Organization (WHO).[471] The daily coronavirus task force briefings ended in late April, after a briefing at which Trump suggested the dangerous idea of injecting a disinfectant to treat COVID-19;[472] the comment was widely condemned by medical professionals.[473][474]

Poland's president Andrzej Duda visited the White House on June 24, 2020, the first foreign leader to do so since the start of the pandemic.
In early May, Trump proposed the phase-out of the coronavirus task force and its replacement with another group centered on reopening the economy. Amid a backlash, Trump said the task force would "indefinitely" continue.[475] By the end of May, the coronavirus task force's meetings were sharply reduced.[476]

World Health Organization
Prior to the pandemic, Trump criticized the World Health Organization (WHO) and other international bodies, which he asserted were taking advantage of U.S. aid.[477] His administration's proposed 2021 federal budget, released in February, proposed reducing WHO funding by more than half.[477] In May and April, Trump accused the WHO of "severely mismanaging and covering up the spread of the coronavirus" and alleged without evidence that the organization was under Chinese control and had enabled the Chinese government's concealment of the origins of the pandemic.[477][478][479] He then announced that he was withdrawing funding for the organization.[477] Trump's criticisms and actions regarding the WHO were seen as attempts to distract attention from his own mishandling of the pandemic.[477][480][481] In July 2020, Trump announced the formal withdrawal of the United States from the WHO effective July 2021.[478][479] The decision was widely condemned by health and government officials as "short-sighted", "senseless", and "dangerous".[478][479]

Testing
Further information: COVID-19 testing in the United States
In June and July, Trump said several times that the U.S. would have fewer cases of coronavirus if it did less testing, that having a large number of reported cases "makes us look bad".[482][483] The CDC guideline at the time was that any person exposed to the virus should be "quickly identified and tested" even if they are not showing symptoms, because asymptomatic people can still spread the virus.[484][485] In August 2020 the CDC quietly lowered its recommendation for testing, advising that people who have been exposed to the virus, but are not showing symptoms, "do not necessarily need a test". The change in guidelines was made by HHS political appointees under Trump administration pressure, against the wishes of CDC scientists.[486][487] The day after this political interference was reported, the testing guideline was changed back to its original recommendation, stressing that anyone who has been in contact with an infected person should be tested.[487]

Pressure to abandon pandemic mitigation measures
In April 2020, Republican-connected groups organized anti-lockdown protests against the measures state governments were taking to combat the pandemic;[488][489] Trump encouraged the protests on Twitter,[490] even though the targeted states did not meet the Trump administration's own guidelines for reopening.[491] In April 2020, he first supported, then later criticized, Georgia Governor Brian Kemp's plan to reopen some nonessential businesses.[492] Throughout the spring he increasingly pushed for ending the restrictions as a way to reverse the damage to the country's economy.[493]

Trump often refused to wear a face mask at public events, contrary to his own administration's April 2020 guidance that Americans should wear masks in public[494] and despite nearly unanimous medical consensus that masks are important to preventing the spread of the virus.[495] By June, Trump had said masks were a "double-edged sword"; ridiculed Biden for wearing masks; continually emphasized that mask-wearing was optional; and suggested that wearing a mask was a political statement against him personally.[495] Trump's contradiction of medical recommendations weakened national efforts to mitigate the pandemic.[494][495]

Despite record numbers of COVID-19 cases in the U.S. from mid-June onward and an increasing percentage of positive test results, Trump largely continued to downplay the pandemic, including his false claim in early July 2020 that 99 percent of COVID-19 cases are "totally harmless".[496][497] He also began insisting that all states should open schools to in-person education in the fall despite a July spike in reported cases.[498]

Political pressure on health agencies
Main article: Trump administration political interference with science agencies
Trump repeatedly pressured federal health agencies to take actions he favored,[486] such as approving unproven treatments[499][500] or speeding up the approval of vaccines.[500] Trump administration political appointees at HHS sought to control CDC communications to the public that undermined Trump's claims that the pandemic was under control. CDC resisted many of the changes, but increasingly allowed HHS personnel to review articles and suggest changes before publication.[501][502] Trump alleged without evidence that FDA scientists were part of a "deep state" opposing him, and delaying approval of vaccines and treatments to hurt him politically.[503]

Outbreak at the White House

On October 2, 2020, Trump tweeted that he had tested positive for COVID-19.[504][505] His wife, their son Barron, and numerous staff members and visitors also became infected.[506][507]

Later that day Trump was hospitalized at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, reportedly due to labored breathing and a fever. He was treated with antiviral and experimental antibody drugs and a steroid. He returned to the White House on October 5, still struggling with the disease.[508] During and after his treatment he continued to downplay the virus.[506] In 2021, it was revealed that his condition had been far more serious; he had dangerously low blood oxygen levels, a high fever, and lung infiltrates, indicating a severe case of the disease.[507]

Effects on the 2020 presidential campaign
By July 2020, Trump's handling of the COVID-19 pandemic had become a major issue for the 2020 presidential election.[509] Biden sought to make the pandemic the central issue of the election.[510] Polls suggested voters blamed Trump for his pandemic response[509] and disbelieved his rhetoric concerning the virus, with an Ipsos/ABC News poll indicating 65 percent of respondents disapproved of his pandemic response.[511] In the final months of the campaign, Trump repeatedly claimed that the U.S. was "rounding the turn" in managing the pandemic, despite increasing numbers of reported cases and deaths.[512] A few days before the November 3 election, the United States reported more than 100,000 cases in a single day for the first time.[513]

Investigations
After he assumed the presidency, Trump was the subject of increasing Justice Department and congressional scrutiny, with investigations covering his election campaign, transition, and inauguration, actions taken during his presidency, along with his private businesses, personal taxes, and charitable foundation.[514] There were 30 investigations of Trump, including ten federal criminal investigations, eight state and local investigations, and twelve congressional investigations.[515]

In April 2019, the House Oversight Committee issued subpoenas seeking financial details from Trump's banks, Deutsche Bank and Capital One, and his accounting firm, Mazars USA. Trump then sued the banks, Mazars, and committee chair Elijah Cummings to prevent the disclosures.[516] In May, DC District Court judge Amit Mehta ruled that Mazars must comply with the subpoena,[517] and judge Edgardo Ramos of the Southern District Court of New York ruled that the banks must also comply.[518][519] Trump's attorneys appealed the rulings.[520] In September 2022, the committee and Trump agreed to a settlement about Mazars, and the accounting firm began turning over documents.[521]

Hush money payments

During the 2016 presidential election campaign, American Media, Inc. (AMI), the parent company of the National Enquirer,[522] and a company set up by Cohen paid Playboy model Karen McDougal and adult film actress Stormy Daniels for keeping silent about their alleged affairs with Trump between 2006 and 2007.[523] Cohen pleaded guilty in 2018 to breaking campaign finance laws, saying he had arranged both payments at the direction of Trump to influence the presidential election.[524] Trump denied the affairs and claimed he was not aware of Cohen's payment to Daniels, but he reimbursed him in 2017.[525][526] Federal prosecutors asserted that Trump had been involved in discussions regarding non-disclosure payments as early as 2014.[527] Court documents showed that the FBI believed Trump was directly involved in the payment to Daniels, based on calls he had with Cohen in October 2016.[528][529] Federal prosecutors closed the investigation in 2019,[530] but the Manhattan District Attorney subpoenaed the Trump Organization and AMI for records related to the payments[531] and Trump and the Trump Organization for eight years of tax returns.[532] In November 2022, The New York Times reported that Manhattan prosecutors were "newly optimistic about building a case" against Trump.[533]

Russian election interference

See also: Senate Intelligence Committee report on Russian interference in the 2016 United States presidential election and Steele dossier
In January 2017, American intelligence agencies—the CIA, the FBI, and the NSA, represented by the Director of National Intelligence—jointly stated with "high confidence" that the Russian government interfered in the 2016 presidential election to favor the election of Trump.[534][535] In March 2017, FBI Director James Comey told Congress, "[T]he FBI, as part of our counterintelligence mission, is investigating the Russian government's efforts to interfere in the 2016 presidential election. That includes investigating the nature of any links between individuals associated with the Trump campaign and the Russian government, and whether there was any coordination between the campaign and Russia's efforts."[536]

Once discovered, the links between Trump associates and Russian officials were widely reported by the press.[537][538] Manafort, one of Trump's campaign managers, worked from December 2004 to February 2010 to help pro-Russian politician Viktor Yanukovych win the Ukrainian presidency.[539] Other Trump associates, including Flynn and Stone, were connected to Russian officials.[540][541] Russian agents were overheard during the campaign saying they could use Manafort and Flynn to influence Trump.[542] Members of Trump's campaign and later his White House staff, particularly Flynn, were in contact with Russian officials both before and after the November election.[543][544] On December 29, 2016, Flynn talked with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak about sanctions that were imposed that same day; Flynn later resigned in the midst of controversy over whether he misled Pence.[545] Trump told Kislyak and Sergei Lavrov in May 2017 he was unconcerned about Russian interference in U.S. elections.[546]

Trump and his allies promoted a conspiracy theory that Ukraine, rather than Russia, interfered in the 2016 election—which was also promoted by Russia to frame Ukraine.[547] After the Democratic National Committee was hacked, Trump first claimed it withheld "its server" from the FBI (in actuality there were more than 140 servers, of which digital copies were given to the FBI); second, that CrowdStrike, the company that investigated the servers, was Ukraine-based and Ukrainian-owned (in actuality, CrowdStrike is U.S.-based, with the largest owners being American companies); and third that "the server" was hidden in Ukraine. Members of the Trump administration spoke out against the conspiracy theories.[548]

FBI Crossfire Hurricane and 2017 counterintelligence investigations
In July 2016, the FBI launched an investigation, codenamed Crossfire Hurricane, into possible links between Russia and the Trump campaign.[549] After Trump fired FBI director James Comey in May 2017, the FBI opened a counterintelligence investigation into Trump's personal and business dealings with Russia.[550] Crossfire Hurricane was transferred to the Mueller investigation,[551] but deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein ended the investigation into Trump's direct ties to Russia while giving the bureau the false impression that Mueller would pursue the matter.[552][553]

Special counsel investigation
Main articles: Mueller special counsel investigation, Mueller report, and Criminal charges brought in the Mueller special counsel investigation
In May 2017, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein appointed Robert Mueller, a former director of the FBI, special counsel for the Department of Justice (DOJ) ordering him to "examine 'any links and/or coordination between the Russian government' and the Trump campaign". He privately told Mueller to restrict the investigation to criminal matters "in connection with Russia's 2016 election interference".[552] The special counsel also investigated whether Trump's dismissal of James Comey as FBI director constituted obstruction of justice[554] and the Trump campaign's possible ties to Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Turkey, Qatar, Israel, and China.[555] Trump sought to fire Mueller and shut down the investigation multiple times but backed down after his staff objected or after changing his mind.[556]

In March 2019, Mueller concluded his investigation and gave his report to Attorney General William Barr.[557] Two days later, Barr sent a letter to Congress purporting to summarize the report's main conclusions. A federal court, as well as Mueller himself, said Barr mischaracterized the investigation's conclusions and, in so doing, confused the public.[558][559][560] Trump repeatedly and falsely claimed that the investigation exonerated him; the Mueller report expressly stated that it did not exonerate him.[561]

A redacted version of the report was publicly released in April 2019. It found that Russia interfered in 2016 to favor Trump's candidacy and hinder Clinton's.[562] Despite "numerous links between the Russian government and the Trump campaign", the report found that the prevailing evidence "did not establish" that Trump campaign members conspired or coordinated with Russian interference.[563][564] The report revealed sweeping Russian interference[564] and detailed how Trump and his campaign welcomed and encouraged it, believing "[they] would benefit electorally from information stolen and released through Russian efforts".[565][566][567][568]

The report also detailed multiple acts of potential obstruction of justice by Trump but did not make a "traditional prosecutorial judgment" on whether Trump broke the law, suggesting that Congress should make such a determination.[569][570] Investigators decided they could not "apply an approach that could potentially result in a judgment that the President committed crimes" as an Office of Legal Counsel opinion stated that a sitting president could not be indicted,[571] and investigators would not accuse him of a crime when he cannot clear his name in court.[572] The report concluded that Congress, having the authority to take action against a president for wrongdoing, "may apply the obstruction laws".[571] The House of Representatives subsequently launched an impeachment inquiry following the Trump–Ukraine scandal, but did not pursue an article of impeachment related to the Mueller investigation.[573][574]

Several Trump associates pleaded guilty or were convicted in connection with Mueller's investigation and related cases, including Manafort, convicted on eight felony counts,[575] deputy campaign manager Rick Gates,[576] foreign policy advisor Papadopoulos,[577] and Flynn.[578][579] Cohen pleaded guilty to lying to Congress about Trump's 2016 attempts to reach a deal with Russia to build a Trump Tower in Moscow. Cohen said he had made the false statements on behalf of Trump, who was identified as "Individual-1" in the court documents.[580] In February 2020, Stone was sentenced to 40 months in prison for lying to Congress and witness tampering regarding his attempts to learn more about hacked Democratic emails during the 2016 election. The sentencing judge said Stone "was prosecuted for covering up for the president".[581]

First impeachment

Members of House of Representatives vote on two articles of impeachment (H.Res. 755), December 18, 2019.
In August 2019, a whistleblower filed a complaint with the Inspector General of the Intelligence Community about a July 25 phone call between Trump and President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy, during which Trump had pressured Zelenskyy to investigate CrowdStrike and Democratic presidential candidate Biden and his son Hunter, adding that the White House had attempted to cover-up the incident.[582] The whistleblower stated that the call was part of a wider campaign by the Trump administration and Giuliani that may have included withholding financial aid from Ukraine in July 2019 and canceling Pence's May 2019 Ukraine trip.[583]

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi initiated a formal impeachment inquiry on September 24.[584] Trump then confirmed that he withheld military aid from Ukraine, offering contradictory reasons for the decision.[585][586] On September 25, the Trump administration released a memorandum of the phone call which confirmed that, after Zelenskyy mentioned purchasing American anti-tank missiles, Trump asked him to discuss investigating Biden and his son with Giuliani and Barr.[582][587] The testimony of multiple administration officials and former officials confirmed that this was part of a broader effort to further Trump's personal interests by giving him an advantage in the upcoming presidential election.[588] In October, William B. Taylor Jr., the chargé d'affaires for Ukraine, testified before congressional committees that soon after arriving in Ukraine in June 2019, he found that Zelenskyy was being subjected to pressure directed by Trump and led by Giuliani. According to Taylor and others, the goal was to coerce Zelenskyy into making a public commitment investigating the company that employed Hunter Biden, as well as rumors about Ukrainian involvement in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.[589] He said it was made clear that until Zelenskyy made such an announcement, the administration would not release scheduled military aid for Ukraine and not invite Zelenskyy to the White House.[590]

On December 13, the House Judiciary Committee voted along party lines to pass two articles of impeachment: one for abuse of power and one for obstruction of Congress.[591] After debate, the House of Representatives impeached Trump on both articles on December 18.[592]

Main article: First impeachment trial of Donald Trump
During the trial in January 2020, the House impeachment managers presented their case for three days. They cited evidence to support charges of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress, and asserted that Trump's actions were exactly what the founding fathers had in mind when they created the Constitution's impeachment process.[593] Responding over the next three days, Trump's lawyers did not deny the facts as presented in the charges but said Trump had not broken any laws or obstructed Congress.[594] They argued that the impeachment was "constitutionally and legally invalid" because Trump was not charged with a crime and that abuse of power is not an impeachable offense.[594]

On January 31, the Senate voted against allowing subpoenas for witnesses or documents; 51 Republicans formed the majority for this vote.[595] The impeachment trial was the first in U.S. history without witness testimony.[596]

Trump was acquitted of both charges by the Republican majority, 52–48 on abuse of power and 53–47 on obstruction of Congress. Senator Mitt Romney was the only Republican who voted to convict Trump on one charge, the abuse of power.[597] Following his acquittal, Trump fired impeachment witnesses and other political appointees and career officials he deemed insufficiently loyal.[598]

Breaking with precedent, Trump filed to run for a second term with the FEC within a few hours of assuming the presidency.[599] He held his first re-election rally less than a month after taking office[600] and officially became the Republican nominee in August 2020.[601]

In his first two years in office, Trump's reelection committee reported raising $67.5 million and began 2019 with $19.3 million in cash.[602] By July 2020, the Trump campaign and the Republican Party had raised $1.1 billion and spent $800 million, losing their cash advantage over Biden.[603] The cash shortage forced the campaign to scale back advertising spending.[604]

Trump campaign advertisements focused on crime, claiming that cities would descend into lawlessness if Biden won the presidency.[605] Trump repeatedly misrepresented Biden's positions[606][607] and shifted to appeals to racism.[608]

2020 presidential election
Main article: 2020 United States presidential election
See also: 2020 United States Postal Service crisis
Starting in spring 2020, Trump began to sow doubts about the election, claiming without evidence that the election would be rigged and that the expected widespread use of mail balloting would produce massive election fraud.[609][610] In July, Trump raised the idea of delaying the election.[611] When, in August, the House of Representatives voted for a $25 billion grant to the U.S. Postal Service for the expected surge in mail voting, Trump blocked funding, saying he wanted to prevent any increase in voting by mail.[612] He repeatedly refused to say whether he would accept the results of the election and commit to a peaceful transition of power if he lost.[613][614]

Biden won the election on November 3, receiving 81.3 million votes (51.3 percent) to Trump's 74.2 million (46.8 percent)[615][616] and 306 Electoral College votes to Trump's 232.[617]

2020 Electoral College results; Trump lost 232–306.
At 2 a.m. the morning after the election, with the results still unclear, Trump declared victory.[618] After Biden was projected the winner days later, Trump said, "this election is far from over" and baselessly alleged election fraud.[619] Trump and his allies filed many legal challenges to the results, which were rejected by at least 86 judges in both the state and federal courts, including by federal judges appointed by Trump himself, finding no factual or legal basis.[620][621] Trump's unsubstantiated allegations of widespread voting fraud were also refuted by state election officials.[622] After Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) director Chris Krebs contradicted Trump's fraud allegations, Trump dismissed him on November 17.[623] On December 11, the U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear a case from the Texas attorney general that asked the court to overturn the election results in four states won by Biden.[624]

Trump withdrew from public activities in the weeks following the election.[625] He initially blocked government officials from cooperating in Biden's presidential transition.[626][627] After three weeks, the administrator of the General Services Administration declared Biden the "apparent winner" of the election, allowing the disbursement of transition resources to his team.[628] Trump still did not formally concede while claiming he recommended the GSA begin transition protocols.[629][630]

The Electoral College formalized Biden's victory on December 14.[617] From November to January, Trump repeatedly sought help to overturn the results of the election, personally pressuring various Republican local and state office-holders,[631] Republican state and federal legislators,[632] the Justice Department,[633] and Vice President Pence,[634] urging various actions such as replacing presidential electors, or a request for Georgia officials to "find" votes and announce a "recalculated" result.[632] On February 10, 2021, Georgia prosecutors opened a criminal investigation into Trump's efforts to subvert the election in Georgia.[635]

Trump did not attend Biden's inauguration, leaving Washington for Florida hours before.[636]

Concern about a possible coup attempt or military action
In December 2020, Newsweek reported the Pentagon was on red alert, and ranking officers had discussed what they would do if Trump decided to declare martial law. The Pentagon responded with quotes from defense leaders that the military has no role to play in the outcome of elections.[637]

When Trump moved supporters into positions of power at the Pentagon after the November 2020 election, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Mark Milley and CIA director Gina Haspel became concerned about the threat of a possible coup attempt or military action against China or Iran.[638][639] Milley insisted that he should be consulted about any military orders from Trump, including the use of nuclear weapons, and he instructed Haspel and NSA director Paul Nakasone to monitor developments closely.[640][641]

January 6 Capitol attack

See also: Timeline of the January 6 United States Capitol attack
On January 6, 2021, while congressional certification of the presidential election results was taking place in the United States Capitol, Trump held a rally at the Ellipse, Washington, D.C., where he called for the election result to be overturned and urged his supporters to "take back our country" by marching to the Capitol to "show strength" and "fight like hell".[642][643] Trump's speech started at noon. By 12:30 p.m., rally attendees had gathered outside the Capitol, and at 1 p.m., his supporters pushed past police barriers onto Capitol grounds. Trump's speech ended at 1:10 p.m., and many supporters marched to the Capitol as he had urged, joining the crowd there. Around 2:15 p.m. the mob broke into the building, disrupting certification and causing the evacuation of Congress.[644] During the violence, Trump posted mixed messages on Twitter and Facebook, eventually tweeting to the rioters at 6 p.m., "go home with love & in peace", but describing them as "great patriots" and "very special", while still complaining that the election was stolen.[645][646] After the mob was removed from the Capitol, Congress reconvened and confirmed the Biden election win in the early hours of the following morning.[647] There were many injuries, and five people, including a Capitol Police officer, died.[648]

In March 2023, Trump collaborated with incarcerated rioters on a song to benefit the prisoners. It sold 33,000 downloads in its first week and debuted at no. 1 on Billboard's Digital Song Sales chart.[649][650]

On January 11, 2021, an article of impeachment charging Trump with incitement of insurrection against the U.S. government was introduced to the House.[651] The House voted 232–197 to impeach Trump on January 13, making him the first U.S. president to be impeached twice.[652] The impeachment, which was the most rapid in history, followed an unsuccessful bipartisan effort to strip Trump of his powers and duties via Section 4 of the 25th Amendment.[653] Ten Republicans voted for impeachment—the most members of a party ever to vote to impeach a president of their own party.[654]

On February 13, following a five-day Senate trial, Trump was acquitted when the Senate voted 57–43 for conviction, falling ten votes short of the two-thirds majority required to convict; seven Republicans joined every Democrat in voting to convict, the most bipartisan support in any Senate impeachment trial of a president or former president.[655][656] Most Republicans voted to acquit Trump, although some held him responsible but felt the Senate did not have jurisdiction over former presidents (Trump had left office on January 20; the Senate voted 56–44 the trial was constitutional).[657] Included in the latter group was McConnell, who said Trump was "practically and morally responsible for provoking the events of the day", but "constitutionally not eligible for conviction".[658]
